### [Project Description](doc/Proj1_desc.md)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Spring 2019

+ Projec title: The Origins of Males and Females' happiness
+ This project is conducted by [Tianyi Li]

+ Project summary:  In this project, I explore the texts from HappyDB, "a corpus of 100,000 crowd-sourced happy moments". I apply text mining techniques to explore what components make people feel happy. Intriguingly, I identify several happiness sources from two genders' written happiness expressions. Moreover, from this project, we can identify the ideology of two genders' happiness.
