Then we pick the ten most frequent words appeared in man's sentence.
We can notice that the words are almost the same but the frequenct order is different. Like "game", it only frequently appeared in males' sentences, while "birthday" only frequently appeared in females' sentences. Therefore, different events or different people can bring different level of emotion to females and males.
Now we go further investigation in their happiness categories.

## Predicted Category
